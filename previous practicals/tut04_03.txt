1. When placed facing and perpendicular to a smooth surface such as a wall, what are the minimum
and maximum depths that the sensor can reliably measure?

The sensor can reliably detect distances from 3cm (however note answer to part 3 for <10cm) up to approximately 120cm. Outside of this range, the sonar returns inaccurate values or 255.

2. Move the sonar so that it faces the wall at an angle. What is the maximum angular deviation from
perpendicular to the wall at which it will still give sensible readings?

The maximum angular deviation at which the sonar works correctly is approximately 45 degrees.

3. Do your sonar depth measurements have any systematic (non-zero mean) errors? To test this, set
up the sensor at a range of hand-measured depths (20cm, 40cm, 60cm, 80cm, 100cm) from a wall
and record depth readings. Are they consistently above or below what they should be?

The sonar consistently reports depths slightly higher than the true depth.

At distances of <10cm the sonar consistently return values 4cm higher than the true distance.

 20cm: 23cm
 40cm: 41cm
 60cm: 63cm
 80cm: 84cm
100cm: 102cm

4. What is the the accuracy of the sonar sensor and does it depend on depth? At each of two chosen
hand-measured depths (40cm and 100cm), make 10 separate depth measurements (each time
picking up and replacing the sensor) and record the values. Do you observe the same level of
scatter in each case?

40cm: 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43
(These results seem crazy but I actually did pick it up and replace it each time)

100cm: 104 105 104 106 104 255 104 107 104 105

There was more variation at higher distances.

5. In a range of general conditions for robot navigation, what fraction of the time do you think your
sonar gives garbage readings very far from ground truth?

Out of 456 samples from a general representative use case for the sonar, 8 were anomalous (a proportion of 0.01754385964 or ~1.8%.)
