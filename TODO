Practical 7:
 ✔ Signature should not store the number of bins, it's a global @done (14-03-07 16:58)
 ✔ Add waypoint name to signature @done (14-03-07 16:58)
Practical 5: 
 ☐ Fix particle filter: it is very innacurate -- the navigation logic might need to be rewritten/fixed, and the rest touroughly reviewed for mistakes (we just discoverd that we had a bug in toPIPI function when rotation was large)
 Practical 6:
 ✔ Physical: Mount sonar sensor on robot using gear for accurate rotation @done (14-03-04 13:37)
 ✔ Implementation: Perform measurments on rotating sensor every N degrees @done (14-03-04 13:37)
 ☐ Physical: scan map at given location, and store measurments to disk (seet test_signatures.py)
 ✔ Implementation: SignatureRecognizer is able to return the absolute shift in number of bins (cycle rotate) between 2 Signatures -- we need to write an additional method that converts this into the angle. Additionally, this code performs an exhaustive search... should be able to optimize easily by rotating the signatures so that the minimum value is first or something similar @done (14-02-25 17:48)
 ☐ Physical: 4.3 -- probably should just be testing and minor fixes one the above tasks are done.
